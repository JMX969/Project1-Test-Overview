# Project1-Test-Overview
Test project 1, Not final

## Repositories
Project 1 Overview: This project serves as an overview to implement source control through git.
The entire semester project will be split up into 5 sub-projects within an agile scrum environment.
Each project will have it's own repository and all of them will link together into a central overview project,
with repository: CMPG323 Overview - 23523778

Project 2 repository: CMPG323 project 2 - 23523778
Project 3 repository: CMPG323 project 3 - 23523778
Project 4 repository: CMPG323 project 4 - 23523778
Project 5 repository: CMPG323 project 5 - 23523778

## Branching Strategies
Project 1: Branch setup-project: This branch will be used to configurate, setup and update README.md.
This branch will then commit and merge with main branch

Project 2 to 5: Branch development-branch: This branch will be used to work on all the different features for the required project.
The development-branch can then be used by multiple different developers to work on multiple features at the same time.
After finishing a feature, the developer can then commit and merge the development branch with another branch called operational-branch.
operational-branch: is used to test each of the completed features of code cohesively together as a whole. This branch serves as the "testing branch"
before merging with main. This is to ensure the integrity and stability of a functional working main.
